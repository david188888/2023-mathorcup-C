- [question 2](https://github.com/david188888/2023-mathorcup-C/tree/main/question%202) we use the NSGA-IIA of the genetic algorithm
- [question 3](https://github.com/david188888/2023-mathorcup-C/tree/main/question%203) we use the NSGA-3.py model
- [question 4](https://github.com/david188888/2023-mathorcup-C/tree/main/question%204) we use AHP to judge the performance of our model
